## Project Description 
* In this project, the motion detection and G force calculation features of the ADXL345 sensor were used. 
* The i2c protocol is used as the communication protocol.

## Connection diagram
* Our pins that are active because we use the I2C1 line 
* PB6 (SCL) and PB7 (SDA) pins.
